# Hamburgers Delivery Mini-App

This is a hamburgers delivery mini-app, using Create React App to create basic project structure, HTML &CSS to style every component within the project, Javascript to present interactive functions. React is also used to create project framework and achieve component development

## Scaffolding

In the project directory, scaffolding Create React App is used.

### HTML & CSS

1.CSS Module is used to make sure all class names are scoped locally.

2.CSS Box Model is used to create the design and layout of the whole pages.

3.Flexbox is used to align and and distribute space among food items in the food list, cart list searching list and so on.

### Javascript

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
